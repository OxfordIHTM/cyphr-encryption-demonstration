# Demonstration of an R workflow that implements encryption of shared/common files between collaborators

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository demonstrates an example R workflow that implements encryption of shared/common files between collaborators using the `{cyphr}` package. This demonstration uses the vignette found [here](https://docs.ropensci.org/cyphr/articles/data.html).

For this demonstration, the following scenario describes the use case of the example project team.

## Scenario

A small project team of 4 people are collaborating on a research project on cause of death (CoD) data. Given the nature of the data, the team's ethical responsibilities and commitments as per their respective institution's regulatory boards include ensuring that the raw CoD data and all of its data derivatives are kept restricted only to authorised research project team members. In addition, raw CoD data and all of its data derivatives are kept encrypted when stored in each of the authorised research project team members' computers. When sharing the data between each other, the research project team members need to ensure that raw CoD data and all of its data derivatives are encrypted on transit and can only be decrypted by authorised research project team members.

Given this, the research project team need to devise a project workflow that will satistfy the encryption requirements while at the same time allowing access of the data to all authorised research project team members. The research project team is using R or their data management, analysis, and reporting and uses GitHub for versioning.

## Recommended/suggested workflow in R

The most appropriate tool in the R ecosystem that can support the research project team in fulfilling the requirements for data protection is the `{cyphr}` package[^1].

Following is the recommended/suggested R workflow that will meet the requirements for data protection as per the respective institution's regulations.


### Creation of personal SSH keys

The backbone of this recommended/suggested encryption workflow is the use of personal Secure Shell (SSH) protocol keys. Each authorised research project team member should create their personal SSH keys.

There are plenty of guidance available on the internet on how to do this. This [guide](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/droplets/how-to/add-ssh-keys/create-with-openssh/) is one of the most straightforward explanations on how to create your personal SSH keys.

Best practice when generating your personal SSH keys is to always generate a **passphrase** to encrypt your private key once it is generated and stored in your computer. Without a passphrase, anyone that can gain access to your computer will also be able use your personal SSH keys.

Note that this step should be done on the *command line* or *terminal* and not on R console.

### Create a key for the data and encrypt that key with your personal key

This step is a setup step that should be done by the administrator or the research project team lead or any other research project team member whose role it is to determine who has permissions to access the data.

Other members of the research project team will not need to perform this step.

This step is done through the R console (directory or via an IDE i.e., RStudio) and is facilitated using the `{cyphr}` package (hence, the `{cyphr}` package should be installed prior to doing these steps.

For this demonstration, we use a project repository structure where the raw data will be placed within the `data-raw` directory and the processed raw data will be stored within the `data` directory. So, we will setup the key within the root directory of the project repository for clarity and convenience when encrypting and decrypting files within sub-directories.

To create a key, the following command should be issued in R:

```R
cyphr::data_admin_init(".", path_user = path_key_admin)
```

where `path_key_admin` is the path to the personal SSH keys generated by the admin or research project team lead. For purposes of this demonstration, let us say that the admin or research project team lead created their SSH key in the default `~.ssh/` directory. So, the command above can be issued as follows instead:

```R
cyphr::data_admin_init(".", path_user = "~/.ssh/id_rsa")
```

or simply

```R
cyphr::data_admin_init(".")
```

given that the `cyphr::data_admin_init()` function will use the default SSH key path when no `path_user` is specified.

When running this command, the admin or the research project team lead will be asked for the passphrase they created for their personal SSH key (if they generated a passphrase). If the passphrase matches, then R will generate a data key for the project repository and appropriately setup the project for encryption. A directory named `.cyphr` will be created in project root directory (since this is a hidden directory, select *Show hidden files* in your file manager settings to see the directory). This directory should be kept within the project repository and should be committed to GitHub for versioning.

### Add encrypted data to the project repository

Now that the admin or the research project team lead has setup the project repository for encryption, they can now add encrypted data to the project.

For this demonstration, we will use the `iris` dataset as our example raw data. We will store an ecrypted CSV copy of this dataset in the `data-raw` directory using the following commands:

```R
## Get the admin key ----
admin_key <- cyphr::data_key(".", path_user = path_key_admin)

## Store encrypted raw data in data-raw directory ----
cyphr::encrypt(
  expr = write.csv(iris, "data-raw/iris.csv", row.names = FALSE),
  key = admin_key
)
```

To check whether the `iris.csv` file in the `data-raw` directory is indeed encrypted, we can try to read it:

```R
read.csv("data-raw/iris.csv")
```

which results in the following error:


```R
Error in make.names(col.names, unique = TRUE) : 
  invalid multibyte string at '<b4>/M+(<86><e1>9<99><aa><8b><cf>6A<f5>F~<bd><ff<9a><f5><92>t5<ef>{`<96><e0><92>iP¬è<e1><bd>'
In addition: Warning messages:
1: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :
  line 1 appears to contain embedded nulls
2: In read.table(file = file, header = header, sep = sep, quote = quote,  :
  line 3 appears to contain embedded nulls
```

But if we decrypt the file first and then read it:

```R
cyphr::decrypt(
  expr = read.csv("data-raw/iris.csv"),
  key = admin_key
) |>
  head()
```

we are able to retrieve the data into R.

```R
  Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species
1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2  setosa
2          4.9         3.0          1.4         0.2  setosa
3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2  setosa
4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2  setosa
5          5.0         3.6          1.4         0.2  setosa
6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4  setosa
```

### Adding collaborators to access the data

Given that the team uses GitHub for versioning, the next step for the admin or research project team lead is to distribute the project repository as currently structured to their research project team members and authorised collaborators. This will be done by adding them to the project repository as members/collaborators.

Once added, these collaborators can now clone the repository and get their own copies of the workflow on their own machines. When they clone their own copies, this includes the encryption setup made by the admin or research project team lead.

In order for research collaborators to be able to access and decrypt any encrypted data in the project repository, they will need to have created their own personal SSH key and make a request to be added to the project via the following commands:

```R
## Get the collaborator1 key ----
collaborator1_key <- cyphr::data_key(".", path_user = path_key_collaborator1)

## Request to be added ----
cyphr::data_request_access(".", path_user = path_key_collaborator1)
```

### Approval of collaborator request

Once the research project team member or collaborator has made a request, the admin or research project team lead can approve this request as follows:

```R
## View collaborator request ----
cyphr::data_admin_list_requests(".")

## Authorise collaborator request ----
cyphr::data_admin_authorise(".", yes = TRUE, path_user = admin_key)
```

We can check whether the collaborator key has been added by:

```R
cyphr::data_admin_list_keys(".")
```

which now shows 2 keys.
